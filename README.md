# Perrin_Brownian_Motion
A simple script to calculate de mean square deviations in the brownian motion trajectories measured by Jean Perrin, plot the MSD by the interval time and estimate the Avogadro's number by means of the Einstein's relation.

The traj{1..3}.txt files are the three trajectories shown in the perrin_trajs.png. They where obtained using the Tracker Video Analysis software. The raw Tracker file traj.trk is also available.

Spoiler alert: The final result is already shown in the msd-t-perrin.pdf file, and the Avogadro's number is estimated as $(6.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{23}$.
